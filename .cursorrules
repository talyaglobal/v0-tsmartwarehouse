# Cursor AI Rules for TSmart Warehouse Project

## Supabase Migration Auto-Push Policy

When creating or modifying Supabase migration files:
1. **Automatically attempt to push** the migration using `supabase db push` or `npx supabase db push`
2. If push fails due to CLI not being installed/linked:
   - Note this in the response
   - Migration file is ready for manual execution via Supabase Dashboard
3. If migration errors occur during push:
   - Fix the errors in the migration file
   - Attempt to push again automatically
4. **Never ask the user to manually push migrations** - handle this automatically

## General Development Rules

- Always use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Follow the existing code patterns and architecture
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed
- All user-facing text must be in English (no Turkish)
- Write comprehensive error handling
- Update relevant documentation when making significant changes
